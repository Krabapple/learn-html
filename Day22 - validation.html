		<li> Browsers nowadays are smart enough to fix the bad coding for you. But you still need to check. </li>
		<li> So use validator! A validator will make sure if we've done everything correctly. </li>
		<li> <a href="http://validator.w3.org" target="blank">validator.w3.org</a></li>
		<li> Don't blindly follow the validator - it's not a rule. If you know what you're doing, then keep going. </li>
		<li> Check between the validator and your html file. If the warnings/errors the validator shows are fine in html, just skip it. </li>
		<li> While doing a project, check in the validator few hours or so to make sure everything is fine. </li>
		<li> When your CSS doe not take effect, first <strong>CHECK IN THE VALIDATOR.</strong> </li>
