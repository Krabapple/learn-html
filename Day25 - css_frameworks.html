	<ul>
		<li> Type "doc" and hit Tab will generate a html default template for you! No more annoying typing! </li>
		<li> Use grid 12 or grid 16 for your webpage. </li>
		<li> When linking to CSS, it's better to put several CSSs' content into one CSS file and link to it. </li>
		<li> div.wrap>header>h1{My Website}+nav>ul>li*3>a[href=#] </li>
		<li> 960 framework is specially made for the webpages that have a width of 960. </li>
		<li> Put grid in a class (not an ID). Multiple classes and be separated by spaces. </li>
		<li> 960 framework provides a class of clearfix</li>
		<li> Use alpha and omega to set the margin for the first and the last column.<br>
		alpha = left margin zero for the first column<br>
		omega = right margin zero for the last column</li>
		<li>Padding is applied in addition to the width in the newer version. However you can override it by setting border-box, and the padding will be pushed inside the box and the width of the box will remain the same - padding is reduced from the width.</li>
