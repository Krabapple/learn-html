<h1> TIL that: </h1>
	<ol>
		<li> &ltimg src=" "&gt inside h1 tag is fine but making the picture a background in CSS is better. </li>
		<li> Do not forget the periods in "../img/osi_symbol.png", since the CSS file is in the css folder and the png is in the img folder. </li>
		<li> The heading tag takes up the entire line, so we should write "no-repeat" in order to avoid image repeating. </li>
		<li> Check the width and height of the image and define them in CSS.<br>
		It will fit the image and will not cut it. </li>
		<li> In CSS, make the text-indent be a large negative number to push the title off the page. </li>
		<li> So why keeping the text? It will be useful if the browser cannot display the image or the image is broken. </li>
